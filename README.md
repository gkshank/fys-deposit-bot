# FY'S PROPERTY DEPOSIT BOT

**Developer**: FY'S PROPERTY üïäÔ∏è

A **WhatsApp Deposit Bot** that integrates with [Pay Hero](https://backend.payhero.co.ke/) for MPESA STK pushes.  
It offers a **two-step countdown** to avoid spam, admin commands to edit bot messages & broadcast to multiple users,  
and a convenient **Express server** to display the QR code for authentication.

---

## Key Features

1. **Private-Chat Only**  
   - The bot **ignores** group chats (`@g.us`) and only works in **1-on-1** conversations.

2. **Deposit Flow**  
   - Asks for **deposit amount** and **deposit number**, then sends an **STK push** to Pay Hero.  
   - Provides **two** minimal countdown updates at **10s** and **20s**, then fetches transaction status.  
   - Sends **admin alerts** for deposit attempts and successes.

3. **Editable Messages & Channel ID**  
   - The admin (phone number `254701339573`) can **edit** any of the bot‚Äôs text strings, including placeholders (`{amount}`, `{depositNumber}`, `{seconds}`, `{mpesaCode}`, `{date}`, `{footer}`) and the **channelID** used for STK push.  
   - This allows for **dynamic** customization without modifying the source code.

4. **Mass/Broadcast Messaging**  
   - The admin can **send** a message to **multiple phone numbers** simultaneously with a single command.  
   - The bot automatically **formats** phone numbers (e.g. `07...` ‚Üí `2547...`) and **skips** invalid ones.

5. **QR Code Web Server**  
   - Launches an **Express server** on `http://localhost:3000`, displaying the **WhatsApp QR code** for easy scanning.  
   - Once scanned, your bot is authenticated and ready to receive messages.

6. **No Spam**  
   - The deposit flow only updates the user **twice** (at 10s and 20s), minimizing risk of spam or rate-limiting.

## Usage

### 1) Normal Users

- It immediately sends an STK push to Pay Hero.  
- After **10 seconds**, you get a small countdown update.  
- After **20 seconds**, the bot fetches the transaction status and replies with **success**, **failure**, or **pending**.

### 2) Admin User
- The admin is **254701339573** by default.  
- Type **admin** to see the list of admin commands:
  ```
  *ADMIN COMMANDS:*
  1) admin - Show this help.
  2) edit <key> <newText> - Edit a config value.
  3) msg [numbers...] message - Broadcast to multiple users.
  ```
